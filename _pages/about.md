📖 I am a senior student majoring in Computer Engineering within the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Complementing my primary field, I have also pursued minors in both Mathematics and Statistics. As an undergraduate student, I am hornored to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Kani Nickvash](https://nickvashkani.com/), and worked closely with [Prof. Jingrui He](https://www.hejingrui.org/) and [Prof.Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://users.ncsa.illinois.edu/kindr/).

👨🏻‍💻 Currently, I am engaged as a research intern advised by [Dr.Mengyu Zhou](http://zmy.io/) at the [Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence (DKI) Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) under the umbrella of [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). Prior to this, my professional journey has encompassed diverse experiences, including roles as a software development intern, embedded and robotics engineering intern, and product management intern. For a comprehensive overview of my career, please refer to my personal resume [here](/cv/). 

💡 My research interests lie in the intersection of reinforcement learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and data mining, with a focus on LLM few/zero shot learning, graph mining, and contextual bandits.
