RNNs are neural networks that have a “memory” that allows them to process sequences of inputs, such as text, speech, or time series data. However, traditional RNNs are not able to effectively handle long-term dependencies due to the vanishing and exploding gradients problem.</p> <p>LSTMs were designed to overcome this problem by introducing a new kind of neuron called a “memory cell” that can retain information for a longer period of time. The memory cell is a simple unit that can store and retrieve information, and it is connected to three different gates: an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate. These gates are used to control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/neuron-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/neuron-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/neuron-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_1/neuron.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="neuron image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The basic type of an artificial nueron in LSTM model in shown above. </div> <p>The input gate regulates the flow of new information into the memory cell, while the forget gate controls the removal of outdated information from the memory cell.

They have also been used in sequential decision-making tasks, such as controlling robots and autonomous vehicles.</p> <p>One of the benefits of LSTMs is that they are able to handle sequences of varying lengths and can be trained using standard backpropagation algorithms. Additionally, LSTMs can be stacked to form deeper architectures, which allows them to learn even more complex patterns in the data.</p> <p>Despite the many advantages of LSTMs, they also have some limitations. One of the main challenges with LSTMs is that they can require a large amount of data to train effectively, which can make them impractical for some applications. Additionally, LSTMs can be computationally expensive to train and use, which can be a problem for some applications.</p> <p>Effectively, LSTM is a powerful type of RNN that is capable of learning and remembering long-term dependencies in sequential data. It has been widely used in various applications and has shown promising results. However, LSTMs also have some limitations, such as the need for large amounts of data and high computational costs. Despite these limitations, LSTMs remain a popular choice for many sequential learning tasks.</p> <p>In out Project,the model is used to evaluate the data and determine losses over the course of multiple epochs. Specifically, both PyTorch and TensorFlow offer LSTM functionality in each of their respective frameworks allowing for the analysis of our data to be performed. However, there still needed to be hyperparamter tuning in order to result in relevant results and useful information.</p> <h6 id="2accelerators"><strong>2.Accelerators:</strong></h6> <p><em><strong>Google Colab</strong>:</em><br> Specific Settings:</p> <ul> <li>Standard: NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core with 789GB <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">specs</a> or K80 with 1197GB <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/tesla-k80/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">specs</a> </li> <li>Premium: NVIDIA V100 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">specs</a>/ A100 Tensor Core <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Solutions/nvidia-a100" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">specs</a> The premium also comes with TPU v4 with currently supports TensorFlow, Pytorch, and JAX with setup <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/quick-starts" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> </li> </ul> <p>NVIDIA Tensor Cores are specialized hardware components designed for deep learning and artificial intelligence workloads.

They can perform mixed-precision operations, which allow for more efficient use of memory and faster training times.</p> <p>In mixed-precision operations, the Tensor Cores use lower-precision (such as half-precision) calculations for most of the matrix multiplication, but then use higher-precision (such as single-precision) calculations for the final result.

In addition, NVIDIA Nsight Compute CLI (nv-nsight-cu-cli) provides a non-interactive way to profile applications from the command line. It can print the results directly on the command line or store them in a report file.

The central idea is as follows: Many different groups need server cycles, but most of them don’t always need that much power. In fact, most of the time those servers are inactive! The campuscluster is a server network that not only allows users to run programs on their own servers, but also allows users to request cycles from other people’s inactive servers.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/cc-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/cc-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/cc-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_1/cc.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="campus cluster image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The basic framework of Campus Cluster. </div> <p>As shown in the image, each server is connected to two types of queues, a primary and secondary. The primary queue is specific to that server and access is typically limited to the individuals/groups that own that server. The server itself priortizes taking jobs from the primary queue basically giving its owners dibs on the server time. This gives groups an incentive to buy and connect servers to the CC since their server will always priotize their work.</p> <h6 id="3benchmarking-procedure-and-results"><strong>3.Benchmarking Procedure and Results:</strong></h6> <p><em><strong>Procedure</strong>:</em><br> The procedure for benchmarking the model is relatively straightforward and repetitive. Starting with Google Colab, since they have default Jupyter Notebook functionality, they provide a means of testing directly on their GPUs and TPUs, allowing for benchmarking to occur. Additionally, they have packages that can link to Google Drive, which provides 15 GB of free storage, which can allow for the data to be stored there with ease. This connectivity then allows the user to run through the notebook, run the cells, and output results while changing very little.</p> <p>However, with Google, it isn’t exactly clear the exact computer components that are being worked with, and while they claim a GPU is accelerated the computation even on the free version of Colab, it is quite slow compared to the paid version, taking almost 45 minutes per epoch for the run. This is somewhat akin to testing locally, where laptop graphics processing units aren’t nearly as fast as cloud platform ones. However, once opting for the paid version, the per epoch time is much faster.</p> <p>While Google Colab provides ease, AWS offers many more instance types, at the cost of more complication and generally being more expensive. For instance, one cannot read the data through just Sagemaker, requiring spinning an S3 bucket and connecting to this within the instance itself. This is done with relative ease, however, similar to how Google Colab allows for connectivity to S3. It should be noted that Sagemaker does not allow connectivity to Google Drive, somewhat understandably.</p> <p>Afterwards, it is also unfortunately prohibitive to spin an instance on Sagemaker in the Ohio region, which is closest to Illinois. The default instance allowance is 0, meaning any instance that one is interested in must go through a service level agreement to increase the limit beyond 0. This is somewhat cumbersome, because it takes multiple days for approval and processing, resulting in lost time. Due to this, these preliminary results feature only three accelerated instance types using both PyTorch and TensorFlow kernels. However, once the instances are spun, they follow the same procedure as Google Colab; using a typical .ipynb Jupyter notebook resulting in ease of running and waiting. After waiting an appropriate amount of time, the results are presented.</p> <p><em><strong>Results</strong>:</em></p> <table> <tr> <th>Platform</th> <th>Instance Type</th> <th>Kernel</th> <th>Price ($/hour)</th> <th>vCPU</th> <th>Memory</th> <th>Epoch Count</th> <th>Batch/Hidden Layer Size</th> <th>Time to Completion (s)</th> <th>Final Loss</th> <th>Mean Absolute Error</th> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.xlarge</td> <td>TensorFlow</td> <td>0.736</td> <td>4</td> <td>16 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4627</td> <td>0.0000052</td> <td>0.0013</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.xlarge</td> <td>PyTorch</td> <td>0.736</td> <td>4</td> <td>16 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4465</td> <td>1.421</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.2xlarge</td> <td>TensorFlow</td> <td>0.94</td> <td>8</td> <td>32 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4219</td> <td>0.0000052</td> <td>0.0013</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.2xlarge</td> <td>PyTorch</td> <td>0.94</td> <td>8</td> <td>32 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4460</td> <td>1.096</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.4xlarge</td> <td>TensorFlow</td> <td>1.505</td> <td>16</td> <td>64 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4162</td> <td>0.0000050</td> <td>0.0013</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>ml.g4dn.4xlarge</td> <td>PyTorch</td> <td>1.505</td> <td>16</td> <td>64 GiB</td> <td>10</td> <td>32</td> <td>4411</td> <td>0.883</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GCP</td> <td>TPU</td> <td>TensorFlow</td> <td>0</td> <td>4</td> <td>12 GiB</td> <td>1</td> <td>32</td> <td>3758</td> <td>0.0000594</td> <td>0.0024</td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <em><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</em><br> Accelerated computing for machine learning is a necessary procedure to hasten the time it takes to run models. Furthermore, there is certainly, at the very least, an academic market for implemeting machine learning in the high-frequency trading realm. However, there isn’t much insight into how various accelerated computing instances affect the output speeds and results of ML based models for HFT. This project sought to provide preliminary results for thus, creating more talking points into how the cloud can be used for HFT machine learning models.</p> <p>It is of particular interest to compare different cloud platforms between one another, with the main three being AWS, GCP, and Azure, as well as testing locally to see what the cost-benefit analysis is of spending more on instances and if it provides better and faster results. For example, if an accelerated instance costs twice as much as another but only provides a 10% increase in speed, then it is certainly not worth the higher price. This is in fact what the preliminary results show. It can be seen from the table that the 4xlarge instance costs approximately twice as much as the xlarge one, but only provides a few minutes of faster analysis. Interestingly though, this also provides lower losses across the board for both PyTorch and Tensorflow, which may be of particular interest for accurate results. If one seeks the most minimal losses, then evidently more expensive instances do in fact have some benfit toward this, as well as providing faster results. While these results are preliminary with only a single run each at 10 epochs, they do provide some insight into what other accelerated computing types can provide.</p> <h4 id="appendix"><strong>Appendix:</strong></h4> <h6 id="1mlg4dnxlarge"><strong>1.ml.g4dn.xlarge:</strong></h6> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/xlarge_tensorflow.PNG-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/xlarge_tensorflow.PNG-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/proj_1/xlarge_tensorflow.PNG-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proj_1/xlarge_tensorflow.PNG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null;
